## Project Inspiration
The inspiration to build an ecommerce came from the desire of wanting to create an ecommerce store for my mum who is a mobile trade. I hope this will grow her business with less stress. Enabling her customer see her product for their comfort zone while placing order.
I also wanted to enable platform where crypto coins owners can purchase need items with their assets without having to worry about converting it or withdrawing it a their local banks before transacting.
And So i decided to built it as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School
