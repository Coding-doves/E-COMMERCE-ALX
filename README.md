## Project Inspiration
The insiration to build an e-commerce came form the desire of wanting to create an e-commerce store for my mum who is a mobile trade. I hope this will grow her business with less stress. Enabling her customer see her product for thier comfort zone while placing order.

I also wanted to enable platform where crypto coins owners can purchase need items with their assest without having to worry about converting it or withdrawing it a thier local banks before transacting.

And So i decided to built it as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School with a link.
